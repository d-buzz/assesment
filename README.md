# DataLoft LLC, Developer Assesment Test

### TODO

Create a simple social media app with simple functionalities written with React.

The app should be able to create, list and view post.

Use API endpoint below from jsonplaceholder to achieve these.

1. List: `GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
2. Create: `POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`
3. View: `GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/:id`

View details about the api [here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/)

### Recommendations

#### We encourage you to build your app with these technologies if you are familiar with them.

1. `redux`
2. `redux-saga`
3. `redux-thunk`
4. `material-ui`


### Evaluation

Feel free to ask you have any questions you need to ask if need be, or if you need any clarification on the requirements.

When complete, create a private repository in GitHub and invite these users to access your repo: `postnzt`, `stinkymonkeyph`.

We will evaluate your response based on the following criteria:

- Problem solving and design approach
- Architectural approach. We prefer functional components and state management with redux. 
  While you don't have to follow this, you're encouraged to show off these skills if you are familiar with them. 
  Keeping consistency within whatever paradigm you use is, however, important.
- Consistency in style, readability, naming conventions
- Reduce code duplication.
